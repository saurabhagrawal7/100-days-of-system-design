Non Relational Databases - for storing unstructured data like JSON.
  1. Key - Value Store : Amazon Dynamo DB
  2. Column Based Store : Casandra DB
  3. Document Based Store : Mongo DB
  4. Graph Store (represents relationship data like graphs in DSA) : Graph QL 

Criterias to decide?
1. Is your data in structured manner (rows & cols).
2. Response time - low latency & faster response time (non relation databases are faster & has low latency).
