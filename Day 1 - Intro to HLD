Introduction to High Level Design

LLD 
  - Focuses on clean code, loosely coupled code.
  - Coding Part - OOPS, design principles, patterns.

HLD focuses on building architecture of the application.
 - what should be tech stack?
 - reason for that tech stack?
 - cost optimization - What would be the cost like server, scaling.
 - what db will be used?
 - Back of the envelope estimate - no of users your application will able to handle.
 - Diagrams are important not code.
 - based on Distributed Systems.

Horizontal Scaling VS Vertical Scaling 
Vertical Scaling 
  - increasing server capacity like ram as per load.
  - good for small scale application which has limited users.
  - not good for application having millions of users (horizontal scaling is prefred).
Horizontal Scaling
  - increasing number of servers instead of increasing load for single server.
  - these servers are called NODES and are represented by circle. 

What is Distributed Systems?
  -  Entire HLD is based on horizontal scaling i.e. DS.
  -  DS is introduced when we talk about horizontal scaling. 
  -  It complicates the architecture, because if servers increased how will they communicate with each other.
  -  how wil they scale up & scale down.
  -  how a server will share data across other servers.
